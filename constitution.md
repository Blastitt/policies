# [RFC] Christopher Newport University Linux User Group Constitution

> This document was last ratified on [DATE].

The Christopher Newport University Linux User Group (CNULUG) is an online and
in-person community for people who use Linux or who are interested in learning
about it.

We are dedicated to promoting smart and socially aware computer usage.
Our core goals and values are:

- advocacy
- education
- support
- socializing

## [RFC] Mission

CNULUG exists as a general advocate of Linux and open-source software.
We have some important goals related to CNU, however:

- Improve on-campus knowledge and support for Linux and free/open source software (FOSS)
- Building a campus-wide culture around Linux and FOSS
- Help Linux and FOSS users access standard 
  university resources
- Educate users on modern uses of Linux, including security, web development 
  and computer engineering for ARM architectures
- Becoming a meaningful member of the global FOSS community

## [RFC] Membership

We welcome new users and do not charge dues or discriminate about level of
skill. Any Individual who falls under one or more of the following categories is
welcome to be a *Member* of our organization:

- Attended a meeting
- Subscribed to our mailing list
- Are active on our IRC channel (`#cnulug` on [Freenode](https://freenode.net/))

### [RFC] Rank-holding members

A *Rank-Holding Member* is any member who holds an official title within the
organization, besides that of just Member.

Official titles are created and based on different responsibilities that arise
in order to keep the club functioning under normal conditions.

Such new positions / titles are to be appproved by the president and at least
one more existing rank-holding member before it can be assumed.

### [RFC] Elections

A general election by committed members and interested parties associated with
the CNU Linux User Group is held at the end of every academic year to determine
new rank-holding members for the upcoming term. This election is to determine
the people who are to fulfill club officer roles for every **existing**
rank-held position, **excluding that of president**. No new positions are to be
determined by this election. In the event that a position is not voted on, there
is no person available or willing to assume the position, or a conflict is
discovered that prevents the elected person from assuming the role in any way,
the duties of such role will be assumed by the current president of the Linux
User Group until a second election for such role can be made. Secondary
elections happen at the beginning of the upcoming academic year to resolve any
previously found conflicts. Any new ranks / positions that have been previously
approved by the president and at least one other existing rank-holding member
will be determined by this election.

An election is won by a simple majority vote of at least half of the club
members plus one person.

A new president is only determined by the current member holding the title of
president. This is to ensure that only someone who has been determined to be
competent in areas essential / basic to club operations takes over such role.

### [RFC] Funding

A treasurer position is to be apointed should CNULUG receive any funding that requires the club to manage a bank account.

### [RFC] Amendments

The CNULUG Constitution is maintained through Git. Right now, the official copy is located at [https://github.com/cnulug/policies](https://github.com/cnulug/policies)

Amendments may be proposed either at CNULUG general meetings, or through the mailing list. An amendment may be proposed by any active member of the club.

Amendments are officially considered for review through being submitted as pull requests on the mailing list. Once submitted for review, the amendment proposal is discussed through the mailing list as well as in a general club meeting prior to being merged into the constitution.

An active member is any member who has taken part in a club meeting or has posted on the mailing or IRC within the last month.

### [RFC] Bylaws

Bylaws are documented in our [Citizen Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cnulug/policies/blob/master/citizen_code_of_conduct.md#citizen-code-of-conduct).
